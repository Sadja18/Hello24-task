Gmail general settings UI sub clone

- I am using browser localstorage to save the information which needs to persist across multiple page reloads.

- Few button click events (especially which redirect to other web pages) have not been implemented.

- Font assets have not been added. So, changing font family in UI will not actually change the font. This has been done to avoid any possible trademark issues.
